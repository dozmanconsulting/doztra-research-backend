# Admin Features Implementation

This document summarizes the admin features implemented in the Doztra Auth Service.

## 1. Admin Dashboard

We've created a comprehensive admin dashboard that provides key statistics and analytics:

- **User Statistics**: Total users, active users, verified users
- **Subscription Distribution**: Breakdown of users by subscription plan
- **Registration Trends**: User registration by month
- **User Growth Rate**: Percentage growth compared to previous month
- **Token Usage Analytics**: Total tokens used, breakdown by plan, model, and day

The dashboard is accessible via the `/api/admin/dashboard` endpoint and requires admin privileges.

## 2. User Management

We've implemented a complete set of user management features for administrators:

### 2.1 User Listing with Advanced Filtering

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/users`
- **Features**:
  - Pagination with skip and limit parameters
  - Filtering by email, name, role, active status, verification status, and subscription plan
  - Sorting by various fields (id, email, name, created_at, updated_at)
  - Ascending or descending sort order

### 2.2 User Details

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/users/{user_id}`
- **Features**:
  - Detailed user information including subscription details
  - Complete user profile with all associated data

### 2.3 User Creation

- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/admin/users`
- **Features**:
  - Create users with predefined status (active/inactive)
  - Set verification status directly (no email verification required)
  - Assign roles (admin/user)
  - Set up subscription plans directly
  - Specify payment information

### 2.4 User Status Management

- **Endpoint**: `PATCH /api/admin/users/{user_id}/status`
- **Features**:
  - Activate or deactivate users
  - Verify users manually
  - Change user roles
  - Security measures to prevent admins from deactivating themselves or changing their own roles

### 2.5 User Deletion

- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/admin/users/{user_id}`
- **Features**:
  - Permanently delete users and all associated data
  - Security measures to prevent admins from deleting their own accounts
  - Error handling for deletion failures

## 3. User Statistics

- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/users/statistics`
- **Features**:
  - Detailed user statistics
  - Subscription distribution
  - Registration trends
  - User activity metrics

## 4. Security Measures

We've implemented several security measures to protect the admin functionality:

- **Admin Role Verification**: All admin endpoints require the user to have the admin role
- **Self-Protection**: Admins cannot deactivate or delete their own accounts
- **Role Management Protection**: Admins cannot change their own roles
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed error messages

## 5. Database Models

The following models were used or updated to support admin functionality:

- **User**: Core user model with role field
- **Subscription**: User subscription details
- **TokenUsage**: Token usage tracking
- **TokenUsageSummary**: Aggregated token usage statistics
- **UserPreferences**: User preferences
- **UsageStatistics**: Usage statistics

## 6. Implementation Details

### 6.1 Admin Service

We created a dedicated admin service with the following components:

- **verify_admin_token**: Function to verify that a user has admin privileges
- **get_user_statistics**: Function to gather user statistics
- **get_token_usage_statistics**: Function to gather token usage statistics
- **get_admin_dashboard_stats**: Function to gather all dashboard statistics

## 7. Next Steps

The following enhancements could be considered for future development:

3. **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance filtering capabilities with more complex queries
4. **Admin Activity Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for monitoring admin activities
5. **User Impersonation**: Allow admins to impersonate users for troubleshooting
6. **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement more granular permissions within the admin role
