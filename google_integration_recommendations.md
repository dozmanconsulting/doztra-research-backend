## Issue: Content Security Policy (CSP) Warnings

You're seeing several warnings related to Google's authentication and API services:

1. **Sandbox Warning**:
   ```
   An iframe which has both allow-scripts and allow-same-origin for its sandbox attribute can escape its sandboxing.
   ```

2. **CSP Violation**:
   ```
   [Report Only] Refused to load the script 'https://www.gstatic.com/_/mss/boq-identity/_/js/k=boq-identity.IdpIFrameHttp.en_US.hMzovKtfGFk.2018.O/am=AMA/d=1/rs=AOaEmlG2nBjSPulhjQ3j-Vhw7aG_Or6_wA/m=base' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' blob: data:".
   ```

## Solutions

### 1. Update Content Security Policy in Frontend

Add the necessary Google domains to your CSP configuration in your frontend application:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.gstatic.com https://apis.google.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://doztra-research.onrender.com;
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
  font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
  frame-src 'self' https://accounts.google.com https://content.googleapis.com https://*.google.com https://js.stripe.com;
">
```

If you're using Netlify, update your `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://www.gstatic.com https://apis.google.com; connect-src 'self' https://doztra-research.onrender.com; img-src 'self' data: https:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com; frame-src 'self' https://accounts.google.com https://content.googleapis.com https://*.google.com https://js.stripe.com;"
```

### 2. Regarding the Sandbox Warning

The warning about iframe sandboxing is coming from Google's own code and is a standard browser warning when an iframe has both `allow-scripts` and `allow-same-origin` attributes. This is necessary for Google's authentication to work properly.

This warning can be safely ignored as it's part of Google's implementation and not something you can directly fix. Google's implementation is designed to be secure despite this theoretical vulnerability.

### 3. Failed Resource Loading

The error `accounts.google.com/_/IdpIFrameHttp/cspreport/fine-allowlist:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()` is related to Google's CSP reporting mechanism and doesn't affect functionality. This is an internal Google error and can be ignored.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify where your CSP is defined**:
   - Check your HTML templates for `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy">`
   - Check your Netlify configuration (`netlify.toml`)
   - Check any server middleware that might be setting CSP headers

2. **Update the CSP to include Google domains**:
   - Add the domains listed above to the appropriate directives
   - Make sure to keep any existing values that you need

3. **Test Google Integration**:
   - After updating the CSP, test the Google integration features
   - Check the browser console for any remaining CSP errors

## Additional Notes

- CSP is a security feature that helps prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
- It's important to balance security with functionality
- Only add domains to your CSP that you trust and need for your application to function
- Consider using CSP reporting to monitor for violations in production
