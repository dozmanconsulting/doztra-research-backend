# Update Render Environment Variables

Add the following environment variable to your Render service:

CORS_ORIGINS='["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:8000", "https://doztra.ai", "https://doztra.netlify.app", "https://www.doztra.netlify.app"]'

This will allow requests from your Netlify domain to access the backend API.

# Steps to update on Render:
1. Log in to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your "doztra-research" service
3. Go to the "Environment" tab
4. Find the CORS_ORIGINS variable or add it if it doesn't exist
5. Update its value to the string above
6. Click "Save Changes" and wait for the service to redeploy
