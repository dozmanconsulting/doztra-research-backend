Therefore, submission will only be accepted up until Friday 15th August 2025  by \n18.00hrs. This should NOT be viewed as extra time to complete the assessment but is provided to \nallow for any unforeseen technical issues that may occur around the submission deadline, especially \nwhen Turnitin is handling large numbers of submissions.   \nPlease note that this assessment is eligible for an extension .  \n  \nAssignment Credit: 40 credits  \nWord Count (or equivalent ): 15000 words +10%; i.e, 16500 words  \n\n\n \nThis document is intended for Coventry University Group students for their own use in completing their \nassessed work for this module . It must  not be passed to third parties or posted on any website.  Page 2 of 9 \n You should state your word count at the end of written work. If you exceed the word limit by more than \n10% (i.e. if you exceed 16500 words , then you r work will only be read up to the allocated limit.   \n \nAssignment Type:  \nPercentage Grade (Applied Core Assessment ). You will be provided with an overall grade between \n0% and 100%. You have one opportunity to pass the assignment at or above 40%.   \n \nAssignment Task  \nThe project is intended to provide you with the opportunity to demonstrate competence in applying the \nconcepts and skills acquired during the taught part of the course. You will apply a level of intellectual \nrigor which is commensurate with the standard of  your Masters level programme of study. The project \nmay be a solution to a practical industry problem/requirement or focus on a research topic. Projects \ncan be either practical problems undertaken for a real client or a research project, normally \nundertake n in conjunction with a research group in the faculty. In either case you will be applying and \nextending skills and knowledge acquired in the taught elements of the course.   \nYou are asked to produce a comprehensive, thorough and professional report, documenting the \nconduct, approach and outcomes of the project, further supported with a critical review of the project \nconduct and management.   \nThe project should include the following:   \n1. Research methods and literature review with discussion and analysis (LO2 & LO3) 30%   \n2. Tools and Techniques used within chosen specialism to help with the construction of chosen \nsolutions and construction of chosen solution. (LO1) 40%   \n3.

All sources of \ninformation need to be acknowledged and attributed; therefore, you must provide references for all \nsources of information and acknowledge any tools used i n the production of your work, including \nArtificial Intelligence (AI).  We use detection software and make routine checks for evidence of \nacademic misconduct.  \nIt is your responsibility to keep a record of how your thinking has developed as you progress through \nto submission. Appropriate evidence could include: version controlled documents, developmental \nsketchbooks, or journals. This evidence can be called upon if we suspect academic misconduct.  \nIf using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in the development of your assignment, you must reference \nwhich tools you have used and for what purposes you have used them. This information must be \nacknowledged in your final submission.  \nDefinitions of academic misconduct , including plagiarism, self -plagiarism, and collusion  can be \nfound  on the Student Portal . All cases of suspected academic misconduct are referred for \ninvestigation, the outcomes of which can have profound consequences to your studies.  For more \ninformation on academic integrity please visit the  Academic and Research Integrity  section of the \nStudent Portal.  \nSupport for Students with Disabilities or Additional Needs:  \nIf you have a disability, long -term health condition, specific learning differenc e, mental health \ndiagnosis or  symptoms and have discussed your support needs with health and wellbeing you may be  \nable to access support that will help with your studies.  \nIf you feel you may benefit from additional support, but have not disclosed a disability to  the \nUniversity, or have disclosed but are yet to discuss your support needs it is important  to let us know \nso we can provide the right support for your circumstances. Visit the Student Portal  to find out more.  \nUnable to Submit on Time?  \nThe University wants you to do your best. However, we know that sometimes events happen which \nmean that you cannot submit your assessment by the deadline or sit a scheduled exam. If you think \nthis might be the case, guidance on understanding what counts as  an extenuating circumstance, and \nhow to apply is  available on the Student Portal.\n\n \nThis document is intended for Coventry University Group students for their own use in completing \ntheir assessed work for this module.
