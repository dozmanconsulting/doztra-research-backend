# Doztra Backend Service Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Token Usage Database Schema Mismatch

**Problem**: The code was trying to insert data with a `timestamp` column, but this column doesn't exist in the database schema. The database has a `date` column instead.

**Error**:
```
ERROR: column "timestamp" of relation "token_usage" does not exist
```

**Files Affected**:
- `app/models/token_usage.py`
- `app/schemas/token_usage.py`
- `app/services/token_usage.py`

### 2. Authentication Issues with Research Projects API

**Problem**: The frontend is getting 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to access `/api/research/projects/`. 

**Potential Causes**:
- Token expiration issues
- Cross-origin request issues with the Authorization header
- Possible issues with the refresh token flow
- UUID serialization issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Token Usage Database Schema Fix

1. Created migration script `fix_token_usage_timestamp.py` to add the missing column if needed
2. Updated `app/models/token_usage.py` to use `date` instead of `timestamp`
3. Updated `app/schemas/token_usage.py` to use `date` instead of `timestamp`
4. Updated `app/services/token_usage.py` to use `date` instead of `timestamp` in all queries

### 2. Research Projects API Fix

1. Created migration script `fix_research_projects_auth.py` with recommendations
2. Created debug script `debug_auth.sh` to test authentication and API endpoints

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the migration scripts:
   ```bash
   python -m alembic upgrade head
   ```

2. Run the debug script to verify the fixes:
   ```bash
   chmod +x debug_auth.sh
   ./debug_auth.sh
   ```

## Additional Recommendations

1. Ensure CORS headers are properly set for all API endpoints
2. Check that UUID serialization is consistent across all endpoints
3. Verify that token refresh flow is working correctly
4. Consider adding more comprehensive error handling for database schema mismatches
5. Add database schema validation on application startup
6. Implement proper logging for authentication and API access issues

## Future Improvements

1. Add automated tests for authentication and API endpoints
2. Implement a more robust error handling system
3. Add database migration versioning
4. Create a health check endpoint that validates database schema
5. Improve the token usage tracking system to be more resilient to schema changes
